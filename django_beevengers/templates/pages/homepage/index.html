    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This Website and accompanying Facebook page is for Alaska beekeepers (Alaska Beeks) and others seeking
        information about keeping honey bees, and maintaining honey bee health, in the 49th state. The honey-producing
        season in Alaska is brief, compared to seasons in other states, and after a mild spring and a wet and sunny
        summer, the calendar is rounded out by sometimes bone-chilling temperatures during our long winter months.
        This page is primarily intended as an encouragement for those involved and considering the art, informed by
        science, of beekeeping. This can become a welcoming question-and-answer forum for all of us. Most of all we
        want to encourage and help Alaska beeks be successful. Please join us in dialogs, questions and answers,
        about beekeeping in Alaska. We'd like to see this Website and Facebook page grow by means of a grassroots
        growth efforts!

    <h1>Different Bees</h1>
    <p>
        Honey Bees are flown up to Alaska each Spring by commercial businesses. Initial orders are placed in late
        January and the first honey bees arrive in early April. So beeks must be ready for them, sometimes, when
        there is still snow on the ground!
    </p>
    <p>
        The three most common types of honey bees that are available here are:  Carniolan, Italian, and Buckfast
        bees. Some Russian honey bees are in Alaska, but they are fewer in number.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following descriptions have been taken from Countrysidenetwork.com
    </p>

    <h2>Carniolan Bees</h2>
    <p>
        Carniolan bees are a subspecies of the western honeybee and originated in what is now Slovenia. They can also
        be found in Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Serbia.
    </p>

        <li>Not aggressive toward beekeepers</li>
        <li>Able to quickly adjust hive size based on environmental issues</li>
        <li>Able to conserve honey stores</li>

        <li>Less susceptible to brood disease</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>

        <li>Prone to swarm</li>
        <li>More likely to need supplemental feeding — especially in the early spring</li>
        <li>Has a hard time in hot summers</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Italian Bees</h2>
    <p>
        The Italian bee is the most popular bee for beekeepers in North American. They were brought to the
        United States in the mid-1800s and are considered the best bee for beginning beekeepers.
    </p>

        <li>Large colonies</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Prone to rob and drift</li>
        <li>Raises brood late in fall which means more mouths to feed in winter</li>
        <li>They do not cluster tightly in the winter so they consume more honey to stay warm</li>

    </ul>
